# Welcome to Vertz

Vertz is a **progressive web framework** that lets you build type-safe full-stack applications with a unified schema. Define your data once, use it everywhere.

## Why Vertz?

- **Unified Schema** — Define your data model in one place, get type-safe UI, server, and API code
- **Progressive Architecture** — Start simple, scale incrementally 
- **Full-Stack Type Safety** — End-to-end TypeScript from database to user interface
- **Modern DX** — Hot reload, instant deployments, zero config

## The Progressive Launch

Vertz is launching progressively to ensure each component is solid:

1. **UI** — Reactive UI framework with signals and components
2. **Schema** — Type-safe schema definitions
3. **Server** — Server-side rendering and API routes
4. **Entities/Domains** — Domain-driven data modeling
5. **Access** — Authentication and authorization
