# UI

Vertz UI is a reactive component framework built on signals.

## Features

- **Signal-based reactivity** — Fine-grained updates without virtual DOM
- **JSX support** — Write familiar JSX with full type safety
- **CSS-in-JS** — Scoped styles with zero runtime overhead
- **SSR-ready** — Server-side rendering with progressive hydration

## Coming Soon

Detailed UI documentation is coming as part of the progressive launch.

### What's Next

- Components and signals
- Styling system
- Routing
- Forms and state management

## Quick Example

```tsx
import { component$, useSignal } from 'vertz/ui';

export default component$(() => {
  const count = useSignal(0);
  
  return (
    <button onClick$={() => count.value++}>
      Clicks: {count.value}
    </button>
  );
});
```
