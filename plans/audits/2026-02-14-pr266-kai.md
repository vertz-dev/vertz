## Summary

**Grade: B** — Exceptional content quality (retrospective, Three Laws, actionable rules), but significant process violations (no ticket, bot-merged to main, unclear authorship).

### Strengths
- Exceptional retrospective with 5 root causes identified
- The Three Laws provide clear decision hierarchy (UX > DX > System Integrity)
- Developer Walkthrough gate is concrete and actionable
- Vertical Slice policy prevents horizontal layering anti-pattern
- Atomic commits with good messages

### Violations
- No ticket found (major violation of "never commit without a ticket")
- PR merged to main by bot (rule requires human CTO approval)
- Mixed authorship: commits by kai@vertz.dev (not in team.json), PR by vertz-tech-lead bot
- No quality gates for documentation (markdown lint, link check)
- No stakeholder approval trail for rules changes

### Recommendations
1. Document kai's identity in team.json (CTO? bot?)
2. Clarify ticket requirements for chores/rule changes
3. Add rules change approval process (VP Eng + Tech Lead + team rep)
4. Add CI quality gates for documentation
5. Separate draft plans from approved rule changes
6. Track adoption of new rules in 2-4 weeks

**Escalation:** Grade is B (≥ B threshold), so no escalation required. However, process issues should be addressed.
