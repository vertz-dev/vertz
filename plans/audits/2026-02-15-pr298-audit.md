**Title:** feat: vertz meta-package with subpath exports

## Grade: A-

## TDD Compliance

**Good.** `subpath-exports.test.ts` (84 lines, 9 tests) written covering all subpath re-exports, no-root-export enforcement, and planned subpath error behavior. Tests verify both runtime behavior and package.json structure.

## Test Coverage

- All 6 available subpaths tested (server, schema, db, testing, ui, ui-compiler). ✅
- 2 planned subpaths (router, signal) tested for correct "not yet available" errors. ✅
- Structural test verifies no root export and unique entry points. ✅
- `sideEffects: false` verified in test. ✅

## Code Quality

- Clean meta-package pattern — each `src/*.ts` is a one-liner `export * from '@vertz/*'`.
- Planned subpaths throw descriptive errors rather than silently failing.
- `package.json` properly uses `exports` field with both `import` and `types` conditions.
- `sideEffects: false` correctly set for tree-shaking.
- No build step needed (meta-package passthrough).

## Security

- No security concerns — pure re-export package with no logic.
- `publishConfig.provenance: true` is good practice for supply-chain security.

## Potential Regressions

- Lockfile changes are extensive due to new workspace package — but all are expected additions.
- `workspace:*` dependencies mean the meta-package always gets latest local versions. Correct for monorepo.

## Notable Findings

Well-structured meta-package. The "throw on planned subpath" pattern is user-friendly — gives clear guidance instead of module-not-found errors.
