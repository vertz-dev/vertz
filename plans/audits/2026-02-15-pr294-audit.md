## Summary

The PR rewrites the CLI README from a reference-style document into a use-case-driven format. Section headings now read as user intentions ("You want to develop locally", "You want to build for production"), making the doc scannable and goal-oriented. The rewrite cuts 453 lines of verbose programmatic API examples and consolidates them behind a link to `./docs/programmatic-api.md`.

## What's Good

1. **Use-case-driven structure works well.** Headings as user goals ("You want to…") are immediately scannable and match how developers actually approach docs.
2. **5-minute rule callout** is a strong meta-commitment to doc quality. Good culture signal.
3. **CLI vs TUI disambiguation** upfront prevents confusion — smart addition.
4. **Significant reduction in noise.** The old README mixed CLI usage with deep programmatic API examples (Ink components, watcher patterns, task runners). Moving those out is the right call.
5. **Updated package references.** Correctly points to `@vertz/server` (with `createServer`) instead of the old `@vertz/core` reference in Related Packages.
6. **`vertz publish` placeholder** is honest — clearly marked as "coming soon" rather than documenting vaporware.

## Issues

### Minor (no rework required)

1. **Broken link: `./docs/programmatic-api.md` does not exist.** The README says "See the [Programmatic API docs](./docs/programmatic-api.md)" but `packages/cli/docs/` doesn't exist. This is a dead link shipping to users. Should be created or the link removed.

2. **Config reference table includes `dev.open`** (default `false`, "Open browser on start") but the config example directly above it *removed* the `open` field (it was present in the old README's example and deliberately deleted in this diff). Inconsistency — either the example should show it or the table should note it's optional/hidden.

3. **`npx @vertz/cli create my-app` vs `npm create vertz-app my-app`.** The old README used `npm create vertz-app`, the new one uses `npx @vertz/cli create`. Both may work, but the project has a dedicated `create-vertz-app` package (`packages/create-vertz-app`). The new command may not be the canonical/recommended path. Should be verified.

4. **No mention of `vertz codegen` command.** The old README documented `vertz codegen` (generate SDK/CLI clients). The new README drops it entirely — not even a one-liner. This is a completeness gap for a command that exists in the CLI.

5. **`vertz routes` description is thin.** Just "Displays every route your application exposes" — no mention of when/why you'd use this (debugging, documentation, CI validation).

## Verdict

The rewrite achieves its stated goal: the README is now use-case-driven, scannable, and dramatically shorter. The structural approach is sound. The issues are minor — a broken link, a missing command, and a small inconsistency — none of which warrant rework. Solid B-grade work.

**Grade: B** — Minor feedback noted. No rework required.
