# First Tweet Drafts — vertz Launch

Three variations for the first announcement tweet. Choose one or thread based on reception.

---

## Variation 1: Hype

> Meet **Vertz**. The TypeScript stack built for LLMs. 🚀
> 
> Type-safe from database to browser. Schema-first. Signal-based UI. No more runtime surprises.
> 
> Your AI agents will thank you.
> 
> 🔗 vertz.dev

**Character count:** 198

## Variation 2: Technical

> Vertz: where TypeScript actually means type-safe.
> 
> Define your schema once → DB queries ✓ API routes ✓ UI components ✓
> 
> Signals for fine-grained reactivity. No vDOM overhead. If it builds, it works.
> 
> The stack AI can actually use.
> 
> 🔗 vertz.dev

## Variation 3: Story-Based

> We watched LLMs get NestJS decorators wrong. Wrong imports. Missing deps. Runtime crashes.
> 
> So we built Vertz:
> • explicit > implicit
> • compile-time > runtime
> • one way > many ways
> 
> Easier for humans. Easier for AI.
> 
> 🔗 vertz.dev

- **Variation 2** for Hacker News or technical audiences
