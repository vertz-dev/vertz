# Vertz Showcase Demo Storyboard

**Duration:** ~2:30 minutes  
**Target Audience:** Developers evaluating modern web frameworks  
**Goal:** Show why Vertz is different — fast, type-safe, and zero-runtime-overhead

## Demo Flow

### Act 1: The Hook (0:00 - 0:20)
- Server-side rendered with Vite - instant, styled HTML
- No flash of unstyled content, no layout shifts

### Act 2: Fine-Grained Reactivity (0:20 - 0:50)
- Filter tasks to show fine-grained updates
- No virtual DOM diffing - only affected nodes update
- Blazingly fast performance

### Act 3: Progressive Enhancement (0:50 - 1:20)
- Forms that work without JavaScript
- Reactive validation when JS loads
- Create a new task with type-safe form handling

### Act 4: Zero-Runtime CSS (1:20 - 1:45)
- Theme switching with CSS-in-JS
- Styles extracted at build time
- No runtime injection overhead

### Act 5: The Pitch (1:45 - 2:30)
- React's DX + Solid's reactivity + Remix's full-stack primitives
- Zero virtual DOM, zero runtime overhead
- Pure, compiled, type-safe reactivity

## Key Selling Points

1. **Fine-grained reactivity** — Updates only changed DOM nodes (no diffing)
2. **Compiler-transformed JSX** — Zero runtime overhead  
3. **SSR with Vite** — Instant page loads
4. **CSS-in-JS** — Zero-runtime extraction potential
5. **Type-safe** — Throughout the entire stack
6. **Fast DX** — Get from zero to app in seconds
