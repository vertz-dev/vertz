# Vertz

**The first TypeScript stack built for LLMs**

Vertz is a comprehensive framework designed from the ground up to build applications powered by large language models. It provides a unified TypeScript API across UI, schema validation, server-side logic, database access, and authentication.

## The Type Flow

Within 30 seconds, here's how types flow end-to-end:

```typescript
// 1. Define your schema (shared across the stack)
import { z } from '@vertz/schema';

const UserSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string().uuid(),
  name: z.string(),
  email: z.string().email(),
});

// 2. Use in your database queries (inferred from schema)
import { db } from '@vertz/db';

// TypeScript knows exactly what shape your data has
const user = await db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?', [id]);

// 3. Expose via type-safe API routes
import { router, procedure } from '@vertz/server';

const app = router({
  getUser: procedure
    .input(z.object({ id: z.string() }))
    .query(({ input }) => {
      return db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?', [input.id]);
    }),
});

// 4. Call from frontend — FULLY TYPED
import { trpc } from '@vertz/ui';

const user = await trpc.getUser.query({ id: '123' });
// user is fully typed: { id: string; name: string; email: string }
```

One schema. Zero type mismatches. End-to-end type safety.
